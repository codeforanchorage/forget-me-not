# forget-me-not
Tech ideas for Facebook Forget-me-not group that helps AK homelesess connect with remote family members.
Alaska is the largest state in the US and plane fligths to communities outside of Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau can easily be over $500. 

My friend, Samuel Johns started the [Forget-me-not FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1607335859320104/) to place images of homeless people (who opt in) with messages to their relatives and friends. 
In less than two weeks it has over 4500+ members and has helped reconnect people.

Samuel asked if we had any ideas for improving the site or expanding it.

Initial ideas:

1. Put the images and messages on a map by location of where the person is orginally from or has lived. Could do easily with CartoDB. Can we automate the process? How do we make it sustainable as it grows.  
2. Using Twitter, Instagram and other social media to spread the images and messages. Twitterbot.
3. Set up appointments for people to facetime or skype with relatives. 

Next steps: Even though it isn't proper Github ettiquite, please add issues for ideas and we can comment on the issues.
